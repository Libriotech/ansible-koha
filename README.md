# ansible-koha
An Ansible role for installing Koha (the FOSS LMS/ILS) on Debian Wheezy.

(Lengthy) Disclaimer:

1) Review this role before you use it! If you don't already know how to
install and support Koha, don't use it.

2) This role is NOT a community-supported method for installing Koha. If
you use it, you won't be able to get support via community IRC, email, etc.

3) I am also NOT planning on actively maintaining this role. I created this
role to automate the installation of Koha on a few Debian boxes during
a specific time period. I might update it from time to time, and pull
requests are welcome, but my purpose in posting this role is inspiration
for others and a convenient archive for myself.

4) This role is designed for Debian Wheezy. It may also work for other
versions of Debian and Ubuntu, but you might need to tweak it a bit
more. Consult the Koha community documentation to make your updates.

5) There are probably other things to talk about, but hopefully you'll
read through the role and understand what is happening so I don't
have to warn you about it.
